Camaguru is a web development project inspired by Instagram, where users can share and interact with images. This project is built using React for the front-end, Redux for state management, Node.js for the backend, and MongoDB as the database. It's a work in progress, aiming to deepen my knowledge of full-stack web development.

This project is built using the knowledge gained from the FullstackOpen course (part 0 - 6), which focuses on building single-page applications using modern web technologies like React, Redux, Node.js, and MongoDB.
